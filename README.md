Erdorbit_random V0.0.3 <br>
Date: 20.06.2017 <br>
Author: Thibaut Voirand <br>

Uses the same principle as Erdorbit (see erdorbit.com). <br>
Generates random orbital parameters, and draws the corresponding orbit in a ECEF frame (Earth fixed, Earth centered). <br>

I basically rewrote the Erdorbit script in Python3, to get to know the language, and added a random parameters generation feature, to find new ideas of interesting orbital parameters. <br>

Added in this version:
  - min and max label above parameters input
  - up button, which rotates the drawing
  - credits in the script
